                    Yu Gwan-soon was only 17 years old when the independence movement took place on March 1, 1919. Yu Gwan-soon joined the movement over the school wall with his friends and shouted "Mansae" with tens of thousands of students and citizens. After that, she went back to her hometown(Cheonan) and agreed with the village elders to hold the independence Movement, and they planned to hold the Movement at Aunae Market on April 1st when would be March 1st in the lunar calendar.
                    
                    <br>She actively led the independence movement by distributing the national flag to the crowd. Many people were injured and killed in the independence movement on this day. After the movement, Yu Gwan-soon was sentenced to three years in prison and jailed in Seodaemun Prison.
