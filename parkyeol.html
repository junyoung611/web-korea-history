                <p class="card-text">The Movie 'Anarchist from Colony' tells the story of the Japanese government, which tried to cover up the incident when more than 6,000 innocent Koreans were slaughtered due to rumors spread after the Great kanto earthquake in 1923, and a young man "Park Yeol," who was campaigning against Japan.

                    <br>On September 1, 1923, an earthquake since the Kwandong area centered on Tokyo almost destroyed Tokyo and Yokohama. The earthquake increased people's social anxiety and created a strange atmosphere of rumors. 'The Joseon people start riots,' 'the Joseon people set fire.', 'The Joseon people put poison in the well.' There have been many groundless rumors.
                    
                    <br>As a result, a tragedy occurred in which Koreans were massacred. Early migrants and who moved to Japan for a more prosperous life and Joseon students became victims of the disaster. In particular, Yokohama is a principal region where more than half of the 6,661 Koreans who were slaughtered during the Great kanto Earthquake. The truth of the great massacre has not yet been clarified.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Patriot Park Yeol Memorial Hall</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">As the March 1 Independence Movement ended in failure and the perception that Joseon's independence was impossible through nationalistic methods gradually increased, young people became interested in the socialist movement. At that time, the association was formed around Park Yeol, Kim Yak-su, and Baek Mu, and gradually developed into an ideological organization that embraced socialist ideas.

                    <br>Anarchism is a utopian ideology and movement that generally rejects all political organizations, discipline and authority as well as organized political class struggles and seeks to realize freedom, equality, justice and brotherhood through the elimination of state power institutions. This means that a state or government organization is inherently harmful and evil, and humans can lead a correct and harmonious life without them. This was regarded as a way of action for national independence by young Joseon people.</p>
