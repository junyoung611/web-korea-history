                <p class="card-text">Poet Yoon Dong-ju died in a Fukuoka prison on February 16, 1945. Only half a year before the independence of Korea, he was 27-year-old. Officially, he died of cerebral hemorrhage, but Dong-ju's death has long remained a mystery. Dong-ju, who was healthy enough to play soccer as a student, died less than a year after being imprisoned in Fukuoka prison. If we see the situation before and after his death, it is clear that he was victimized by a medical experiment.
                <br>Yoon Young-chun who is Yoon Dong-ju's relation went to Fukuoka detention center in 1945 to recover Dong-ju's dead body. He visited Song Mong-gyu, a cousin of Yoon Dong-ju, who was in prison with Yoon Dong-ju, and Song Mong-gyu testified that he and Dong-ju were done a medical experiment on their living body. After saying this, Song Mong-gyu also died three weeks later.

                <p class="card-text">Yun Dong-ju is poet of the Japanese colonial era. He did not actively participate in the independence movement, and neither does his poems show a directly combative character. However, Yoon Dong-ju is also called a resistance poet. The reason may be due to the frankness of poet Yoon Dong-ju in his work. He was suffering from the Japanese colonial era and was be extremely ashamed of the situation he had and what he acted at that time.

                    <br>His poem, 'Prelude(序詩)', is one of the most beloved poems to us. Most of the people who have studied through the curriculum in Korea may have heard of the poem, and even if some people are not very interested in it, the phrase "Let me have no shame
                    Under the heaven
                    Till I die" will be familiar. 'Prelude(序詩)' showed Yun Dong-ju's determination in his beliefs, and aroused warm comfort and beautiful emotion for many young people in this land who wandered in an age of chaos after independence.
                    
                    <br>If you go to the Poet Yun Dong-ju Literature Museum, you will be able to learn more about Yun Dong-ju's poems in detail, and you will also be able to appreciate his poems so much.</p>
