                <h5 class="card-title">Shimonoseki Branch of Yamaguchi District Court</h5>
                <p class="card-text">On August 14, 1991, a victim of the Japanese military sex slave, Kim HakSoon held a official conference about her wound. Upon hearing the news, ‘Korean Women Entrepreneurs Association' in Busan wanted to help the other victims, asking them to report themselves.

                    <br>As a result, four of the victims took part in the trial. On December 25, 1992, a complaint was filed with the Shimonoseki District Court in Japan demanding compensation and apology from the Japanese government. The lawsuit lasted for six years, and in April 1998, the court ruled in part that 'the plaintiff's women are still suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder,' and that they should pay 300,000 yen each to the three victims. 
                    
                    <br>Although the ruling was applied to only a limited number of the victims, but it is historically valuable in that we won for the first time in judgment related to Japanese military sex slavery.

                <p class="card-text">Character 'Moon Jung-sook' is more active in the trial process than anyone else in the movie. The character actually reflected the story of a person named "Kim Moon-sook". As you can see in the film, she was actually tried to receive Japanese government's official apology for Japanese military sex slavery and rightful reward. Even after the trial, she didn't stop. A constantly caring for the trial, she published a museum to teach students right history that related to Japanese military sex slavery.

                    <br>This is the historical museum that she built by spending up to 100 million won.
