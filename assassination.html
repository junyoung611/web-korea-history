                <p class="card-text">The film was inspired by a assassination in March 1932. Kim Gu, the leader of 한인애국단, instructs former members Yu Jin-man and Lee Deok-ju to assassinate the 6th Governor-General of Joseon, Uaki Kazushige.

                    <br>한인애국단 is an anti-Japanese group organized in Shanghai, China in 1931, with the aim of assassinating major Japanese figures. A method chosen by that was armed struggle. This is clearly different from terrorism. According to an expert, "Terrorism is a criminal behavior that indiscriminately attacks and kills unspecified people, but the righteous struggle was to destroy the main culprit of aggression or governing institutions."
                    <br>* The picture is Kim Gu, who was the leader of 한인애국단.

It was originally intended to be named "Yoonok," but the name was changed to "Ok-yoon" because it overlapped with former first lady Kim Yoonok.

                    <br>However, there is another character that became the motif of this character. She is Nam Jahyun, a fighter for independence She contributed greatly to the struggle for independence along with other independence activists, including involvement in the assassination operation of the Governor-General of Joseon.</p>
