                <p class="card-text">Independence Movement of 1919 was a non-violent demonstration of Korea, but Japan continues to suppress it violently. Then there was a opinion in Korea that stronger resistance was needed, and the number of soldiers in Korean independence army gradually increased.

                    <br>The movie 'The Battle: Roar to Victory' describes 'Battle of Bongohdong (봉오동 전투)', which is considered the first victory of them. The name of the battle originated from the location of the battle. This area is located in Wāngqīng Xiàn, China, and is also where the Korean Independence Army successfully won against Japan for the first time in 1920.
                    
                    <br>At that time, the Japanese military was the strongest in East Asia. This is because it had abundant supplies, well-trained soldiers, the incomparable weapons and even practical experience. But on the contrary, the Independence Army had such a problem of poverty that it was difficult to even take care of meals. Nevertheless, in order to compete against Japan, they purchased weapons by cutting back on food. They were also from different regions, classes, and backgrounds. But they fought as one for the country, and eventually won.
